### Purpose program
Watching a snooker game, it can be pretty confusing when it comes to seeing how many possible points are left for each player to score. This is mainly because it differs if a player misses a red ball or a colored ball: if a colored ball is missed, the next ball to pot must be a red ball. This means that the lost colored ball will no longer be available.

This program was written to display how many points are still available throughout the game. This could only be achieved by having the logic follow the games dynamics and rules. As a (desirable) side-effect, the program also shows the current scores and which balls are to be played next.
